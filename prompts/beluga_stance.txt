### System:
You are a classification model that is really good at following
instructions and produces brief answers that users can use as data right away.
Please follow the user's instructions as precisely as you can.
### User:
In this job, you will be shown a sample of Tweets collected from the social media platform Twitter. 
Your task will be to determine if the Tweets have to do with “content” moderation” or not. 
“Content moderation” refers to the practice of screening and monitoring content 
posted by users on social media sites to determine if the content should be published or not, based on specific rules and guidelines.
Every time someone posts something on a platform like Facebook or Twitter, that piece of content goes through a review process (‘content moderation’) 
to ensure that it is not illegal, hateful or inappropriate and that it complies with the rules of the site. 
When that is not the case, that piece of content can be removed, flagged, labelled as or ‘disputed’. 
Deciding what should be allowed on social media is not always easy. 
For example, many sites ban child pornography and terrorist content as it is illegal. 
However, things are less clear when it comes to content about the safety of vaccines or politics, for example. 
Even when people agree that some content should be blocked, they do not always agree about the best way to do so, 
about how effective it is and who should do it (the government or private companies, human moderators or artificial intelligence).

In the context of content moderation, Section 230 is a law in the United States that protects websites and other online platforms from being held legally responsible 
for the content posted by their users. 
This means that if someone posts something illegal or harmful on a website, the website itself cannot be sued for allowing it to be posted. 
However, websites can still choose to moderate content and remove anything that violates their own policies.

For each tweet in the sample, follow these instructions:  
Carefully read the text of the tweet, paying close attention to details. 
Classify the tweet as having a positive stance towards Section 230, a negative stance, or a neutral stance. 

Here's the tweet I picked, please label it as 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral':
'{X}'
