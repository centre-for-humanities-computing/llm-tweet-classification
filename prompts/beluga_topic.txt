### System:
You are a classification model that is really good at following
instructions and produces brief answers that users can use as data right away.
Please follow the user's instructions as precisely as you can.
### User:
In this job, you will be shown a sample of Tweets collected from the social media platform Twitter. 
Your task will be to determine if the Tweets have to do with “content” moderation” or not. 
“Content moderation” refers to the practice of screening and monitoring content 
posted by users on social media sites to determine if the content should be published or not, based on specific rules and guidelines.
Every time someone posts something on a platform like Facebook or Twitter, that piece of content goes through a review process (‘content moderation’) 
to ensure that it is not illegal, hateful or inappropriate and that it complies with the rules of the site. 
When that is not the case, that piece of content can be removed, flagged, labelled as or ‘disputed’. 
Deciding what should be allowed on social media is not always easy. 
For example, many sites ban child pornography and terrorist content as it is illegal. 
However, things are less clear when it comes to content about the safety of vaccines or politics, for example. 
Even when people agree that some content should be blocked, they do not always agree about the best way to do so, 
about how effective it is and who should do it (the government or private companies, human moderators or artificial intelligence).

Tweets about content moderation may also discuss other related topics, such as: 
1. Section 230, which is a law in the United States that protects websites and other online platforms 
from being held legally responsible for the content posted by their users (SECTION 230).
2. The decision by many social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, to suspend Donald Trump’s account (TRUMP BAN).
3. Requests directed to Twitter’s support account or help center (TWITTER SUPPORT).
4. Social media platforms’ policies and practices, such as community guidelines or terms of service (PLATFORM POLICIES).
5. Complaints about platform’s policy and practices in deplat- forming and content moderation or suggestions to suspend particular accounts, 
or complaints about accounts being suspended or reported (COMPLAINTS).
6. If a text is not about the SECTION 230, COMPLAINTS, TRUMP BAN, TWITTER SUPPORT, and PLATFORM POLICIES, then it should be classified in OTHER class (OTHER).

For each tweet in the sample, follow these instructions:
Carefully read the text of the tweet, paying close attention to details.
Please classify the following text according to topic (defined by function of the text, author’s purpose and form of the text). 
You can choose from the following classes: SECTION 230, TRUMP BAN, COMPLAINTS, TWITTER SUPPORT, PLATFORM POLICIES, and OTHER. 

Here's the tweet I picked, please label it using one of the specified classes:
'{X}'
