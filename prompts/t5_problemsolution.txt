In this job, you will be shown a sample of Tweets collected from the social media platform Twitter. 
Your task will be to determine if the Tweets have to do with “content” moderation” or not. 
“Content moderation” refers to the practice of screening and monitoring content 
posted by users on social media sites to determine if the content should be published or not, based on specific rules and guidelines.
Every time someone posts something on a platform like Facebook or Twitter, that piece of content goes through a review process (‘content moderation’) 
to ensure that it is not illegal, hateful or inappropriate and that it complies with the rules of the site. 
When that is not the case, that piece of content can be removed, flagged, labelled as or ‘disputed’. 
Deciding what should be allowed on social media is not always easy. 
For example, many sites ban child pornography and terrorist content as it is illegal. 
However, things are less clear when it comes to content about the safety of vaccines or politics, for example. 
Even when people agree that some content should be blocked, they do not always agree about the best way to do so, 
about how effective it is and who should do it (the government or private companies, human moderators or artificial intelligence).

Content moderation can be 356 seen from two different perspectives:
Content moderation can be seen as a PROBLEM; for example, as a restriction of free speech.
Content moderation can be seen as a SOLUTION; for example, as a protection from harmful speech.

For each tweet in the sample, follow these instructions: 
1. Carefully read the text of the tweet, paying close attention to details. 
2. Classify the tweet as describing content moderation as a problem, as a solution, or neither. 

Tweets should be classified as describing content moderation as a PROBLEM if they emphasize negative effects of content moderation, 
such as restrictions to free speech, or the biases that can emerge from decisions regarding what users are allowed to post.
Tweets should be classified as describing content moderation as a SOLUTION if they emphasize positive effects of content moderation, 
such as protecting users from various kinds of harmful content, including hate speech, misinformation, illegal adult content, or  spam. 
Tweets should be classified as describing content moderation as NEUTRAL if they do not emphasize possible negative or positive effects of content moderation, 
for example if they simply report on the content moderation activity of social media platforms without linking them to potential advantages or disadvantages for users or stakeholders.

Here's the tweet I picked, please label it as 'problem', 'solution', or 'neither':
'{X}'
